### Hi. Luca here.

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science Engineering doing research in Underwater IoT. 
My current focus are Learning-based communication and navigation protocols for networks of Underwater Autonomous Vehicles.
Sapienza Università di Roma is my cosy home where I also pursued my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science.
