### Hi. Luca here.

I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science Engineering doing research in Underwater Robotics. 
My current focus is underwater navigation and localization of Underwater Autonomous Vehicles.
Sapienza Università di Roma is my cosy home where I also pursued my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science.
