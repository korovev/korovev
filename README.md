### Hi. Luca here 

I'm a passionate Computer Scientist doing research in Underwater IoT. 
My current focus are Reinforcement Learning-based communication protocols for networks of Underwater Autonomous Vehicles.
Sapienza Universit√† di Roma is my confortable house where I pursued the B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science and about to start my PhD in Computer Science Engineering.
